Game rules

1. Place cards face down in random order.
2. Player 1 flips over a pair of cards, one at a time. If the cards match, player 1 goes again.
3. If they don’t match, the cards are flipped back over and it’s the next player’s turn.
4. Keep playing until there are no more cards to turn over. The person with the most matches wins.
