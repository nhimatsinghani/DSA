Additional info about the interview :
Think about project(s) you have been involved in where you have had impact, learnt lessons and felt stretched.
These projects don’t always have to be your best ones.
In addition, think about times in your career where you have had to work together with other teammates, teams or customers to achieve meaningful outcomes together.

This will be a structured interview where we will ask questions that will dig into four primary areas:

- Your ability to drive outcomes across the software development lifecycle
- How you apply lessons learnt on the job and share them
- Your ability to manage conflict across various situations
- How you take initiative, lead and inspire in your role

In addition to the above, we are keen to understand how you
collaborate with your teams and get a deeper sense on your
passions and ambitions to ensure the role is in fact the right one
for you!

Some questions that I found online that are asked in this interview :

1. Did you ever put your team ahead of your personal goals?
2. Did you take any initiative to improve the current system in your team?
3. Did you ever oppose someone’s technical approach and how?
4. What was the most challenging task you have faced?
5. Did you ever convince other teams to align with your thought process?
