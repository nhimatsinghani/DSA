To make sure we are interviewing candidates  in a way that will help them demonstrate alignment with Atlassian values, we have  developed a questions library that all interviewers pull from. Here are some sample  behavioural questions from that library: 

PLAY, AS A TEAM : 
Describe a situation in which you had to arrive  at a compromise with someone to move a project forward. Tell me about a time you were working on a project where your co-collaborators were holding back the process. 
How do you work with other people? How have you helped make a team/individual more successful if they weren’t performing well? Have you ever had to put the team’s goals above personal ambitions?

BUILD WITH HEART AND BALANCE :  
Tell me about a time that you had to balance competing business, team, or project priorities. Tell me about a time when you had to make a  decision without all the information you needed. 
How do you think about prioritisation and decision making? What are examples when you or the team have missed the mark? How did you react? How did you approach fixing things?


OPEN COMPANY, NO BULLSHIT : 
Tell me about a time your first impression of  a person or situation was incorrect. Tell me about a time you had a different point  of view about how to solve a problem with  someone on your team. 
What's your approach when having difficult conversations? How have you resolved conflict in the past? Have you adapted your communication style to achieve a better outcome in a potentially negative situation?


BE THE CHANGE YOU SEEK : 
Share an example of a time when you were able to turn around the performance of an individual  or team. Tell me about a time that you supported your team / a teammate to manage a major change. 
When have you advocated to push for change? What did you learn from this process? What was the outcome?

DON’T #@!% THE CUSTOMER :  Tell me about a time when you had to make a tradeoff that involved potentially causing pain for a user or customer. Tell me about a time when you advocated for the customer, despite opposition.
How is your mentality ‘user-centred’? How have you put the customer first? What trade-off(s) did you make to do this?




Some questions that I found online that are asked in this interview : 
1. Biggest challenge you faced so far in your career?
2. Did you ever put your team ahead of your personal goals?
3. Did you face any issues with any teammates performance how did you?resolve it?
4. Did you ever commit anything and were not able to deliver it on time?
5. Did you drive any change in the team which ultimately for rejected?
