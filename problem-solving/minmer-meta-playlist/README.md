## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No module named 'yt_dlp'"**

   - Solution: Install yt-dlp using `pip install yt-dlp`

2. **"Unable to extract playlist"**

   - Check if the playlist URL is correct
   - Ensure the playlist is public (not private)
   - Try again later if YouTube is temporarily blocking requests

3. **"Permission denied" when writing CSV**
   - Make sure you have write permissions in the current directory
   - Try running with different filename or in different directory

### Getting Playlist URL

To get the correct playlist URL:

1. Go to YouTube and open the playlist
2. Copy the URL from the address bar
3. The URL should contain `list=` parameter

## Notes

- The script uses `yt-dlp` which is actively maintained and handles YouTube's changes
- No downloading occurs - only metadata extraction
- The script respects YouTube's terms of service
- Private or restricted playlists cannot be accessed
